                <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities that allows you to build interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.</p>

                <h3>What is Callback?</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>A callback is a plain JavaScript function passed to some method as an argument or option. It is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing, hence the name ‘call back‘. In JavaScript, functions are objects. Because of this, functions can take functions as arguments, and can be returned by other functions.</p>

                <h3> What is Closure? Give an example.</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Closures are created whenever a variable that is defined outside the current scope is accessed from within some inner scope. It gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created. To use a closure, simply define a function inside another function and expose it.</p>
